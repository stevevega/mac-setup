After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it\nsends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While\nprocessing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends whitespace\ncharacters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request\ncould fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is\nimportant that you check the response body to determine whether the\nrequest succeeded. Note that if Complete Multipart Upload fails,\napplications should be prepared to retry the failed requests.","children":[{"kind":32,"name":"__construct","modifiers":1,"location":[28,4,33,5],"scope":"Aws\\S3\\IncompleteMultipartUploadChecker","children":[{"kind":128,"name":"$next","location":[28,32,28,69],"scope":"__construct","value":"null","typeSource":1,"type":"Guzzle\\Plugin\\Backoff\\BackoffStrategyInterface"}]},{"kind":32,"name":"makesDecision","modifiers":1,"location":[35,4,38,5],"scope":"Aws\\S3\\IncompleteMultipartUploadChecker"},{"kind":32,"name":"getDelay","modifiers":2,"location":[40,4,54,5],"scope":"Aws\\S3\\IncompleteMultipartUploadChecker","children":[{"kind":128,"name":"$retries","location":[41,8,41,16],"scope":"getDelay"},{"kind":128,"name":"$request","location":[42,8,42,33],"scope":"getDelay","typeSource":1,"type":"Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface"},{"kind":128,"name":"$response","location":[43,8,43,33],"scope":"getDelay","value":"null","typeSource":1,"type":"Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Response"},{"kind":128,"name":"$e","location":[44,8,44,31],"scope":"getDelay","value":"null","typeSource":1,"type":"Guzzle\\Http\\Exception\\HttpException"}]}]}]}}
